## An Important Note About Support

Monica (in common with all of my ExpressionEngine add-ons) is no longer officially supported.

The source code is reasonably well-documented, and you are free to fork the repo if you'd like to make some changes or improvements (it's distributed under a liberal open source license).

Hopefully this will be everything you need to use this add-on in your projects, but if not please don't email me asking for support; I don't even have ExpressionEngine installed locally any more.
